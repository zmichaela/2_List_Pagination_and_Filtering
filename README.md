# 2_List_Pagination_and_Filtering

 Second Treehouse Degree Project

This is a page that contains a list of 54 student names, photos and email addresses. I used JS to display 10 names at a time and added a navigation system (links at the bottom of the page) so users can click-- to let users click through to the additional page which display other students (10 per page).

To start off, I declared my two global variables (first one to store the student list item elements in the student list, the second one to store the number of items to show on each page - 10)


I created two functions:
The first one called showPage allowing me to hide all the students except for the 10 I want to display per page.

The second function called appendPageLinks which creates and appends functioning pagination links (buttons).
